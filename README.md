# Inspect WAV

Simple CLI tool for fetching info from a WAV file.

This just unpacks the initial `RIFF` and `fmt` header to the console.

It was useful for some of my own work. I might add on features later.

# ToDo
- Print out [specification-compliant data](https://www.mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/WAVE/WAVE.html)
- Move to [RataTUI](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) or a generally more aesthetically pleasing TUI
